## Hi there! My name is Sofia Azam

I'm a computer science and mathematics major at East Carolina University, and will be graduating this May 2026. I will be starting my MS in Data Science, following the track in Applications of Physical, Biological, and Health Sciences, in Fall 2026 at UNC Chapel Hill. I love working with data and am passionate about using technology to positively impact communities and people. I hope to pursue a career in healthcare data analytics to continue this passion.
